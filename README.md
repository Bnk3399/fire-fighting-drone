# Fire fighting drone

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

* I am excited to explore how one of our fastest evolving technologies, AI-enabled drones, can be a game changer to help firefighters quickly find victims over a large area where visibility or other accessibility issues may give drones an advantage over humans, human firefighters will always be essential for the actual rescue but the drone may be able to deliver essential resources or be used as an vehicle to perform essential communication functions so that the victim can receive the best attention until they are able to be transported out of the situation


## Background

* Solve the problems of high rate of destroying lives and properties. 
* The problems is often frequently most especially in Africa and other part of the world
* To change it happen frequently
*  Because its deal of lives and properties in general, so it has to be tackle


## How is it used?

* The flying vehicles will provide support for firefighters by tackling hard-to-reach areas such as high-rise buildings, confined spaces, and warehouses containing hazardous materials. Drone systems are also said to improve response time
*  Easier and useful. 
*  figting fire when started by by through in and out at any environment and any time
* Those in the environment, 
* Always maintain its need, by making sure its working properly.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods

## Challenges

* in high-risk bomb threat scenarios, dedicated bomb especially disposal robots are far too bulky to deployed at a moment's notice
* Drone are far less risky and very cost-effective to  field
* expanding drone technology to more emergency services can be vital to saving lives and better serving citizens
* Controling the fire.
* By making sure all necessary things a done in other to keep safe.

## What next?

* AI-enable drones, can be a game chnager to help firefighters quickly find victims over a large area 
* By accepting the idea.
* AI, 
* Expert guidance and financial assistant.
